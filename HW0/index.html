<h2>Eat the Stars!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
You control a black hole and eat all of the stars to win. It is originial in its application, as this type of mechanism is normally applied to platformers in the form of coins or other incentives. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?

You are free to roam around the arena and collect stars while avoiding another black hole which would be your enemy.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
I learned the basics of game programming using Phaser, along with how to add the basic components of a world into my game.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
The hardest part was having to switch between Phasor 2 and 3 in order to develop a functional game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
The minimal gamestate template is the main template I used, and as such the motion controls have remained the same in that regard. The idea of collecting the stars is seen in any game that implements a reward system where the player must collect something to advance or win. 
Another Phaser 2 example game, <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/custom-sprite-vs-group">Phaser Example Sprite vs Group</a></li> , was also used for inspiration and code was borrowed from this.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Eat the Stars is a fast paced game in which players play as one of the most powerful forces in the universe, a black hole, and must 'eat' the stars around them and avoid being eaten themselves if another black hole is present.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Space and intergalactic travel.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The play style is akin to that of mobile games where the player drags their finger to where the object they are controlling must go.
</li>


<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
A cool fun and enjoyable experience. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can move around and collect stars to grow and win. If another black hole is in the area, the player must avoid being eaten themselves by the other black hole.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
The player should move quickly and master the movement of the black hole and its ability to spin and turn sharply to collect all stars and avoid being eaten by another black hole in the area.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is set 1,000,000,000,000 years after humanity at the end of the Stelliferous era (our current era). At this point in time, it is eat or be eaten with black holes eating all remainining and luminous stars, some black holes will eat others in the process. In other words, its the wild wild west of the universe, and the player must avoid other black holes while eating as many stars as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
All ages, although the game may be more popular with childen ages 5 and older.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
30 seconds to 1 minute depending on the player.
</li>
