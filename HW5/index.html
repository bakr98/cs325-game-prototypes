<h2>Space Time Continuum (Iteration 2)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Author:</strong>	
	Bakr Marouf
</li>
	
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
	The X-eltors, your people's energy source have been stolen from you and spread across the universe. Journey across several galaxies and planets solving different kinds of puzzles from space puzzles in your ship to platforming puzzles like never before with a split mechanic when you land on specific planets.
</li>
	
<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
For this iteration, the synchroniously moving background elements in the galaxy and a panoramic background. The area set up is meant to serve as a dynamic level select and puzzle in finding the X-eltors (count displayed at all times) as well as keeping track of your health and charge of your ship. There are complete planet levels available for play in which the player can shift from space mode to a platformer puzzle mode and can leave the level when they finish the level and reach their rocket ship at the end of the level.
</li>
	
<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to create various collisions, a swarm of objects moving in different directions, and keeping track of various resources such as health and the X-eltors throughout scenes, I set up the platformer/maze and puzzle section of the game and this can be seen in the planet levels linked. I plan to polish this game more in the future and possibly release a polished product on the Android Play Store, iOS App Store, or simply online with all the levels ready and a final boss before beating the game itself.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The X-eltors, your people's energy source have been stolen from you and spread across the universe. Journey across several galaxies and planets solving different kinds of puzzles from space puzzles in your ship to platforming puzzles like never before with a split mechanic when you land on specific planets.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
	Puzzles, Action, Space
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Keyboard. Randomness: Some. Play Styles: Explorer, Collector. Genre: Puzzle/Platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype was intended to improve upon the setup the of the elements needed for the complete game to run smoothly, the levels are now set up and can be played. If the levels does not load click the link below to go directly to the level.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to go around the galaxy and experience the game firsthand while looking for the X-eltors throughout the galaxies and landing on planets.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The goal of the game is to get all of the X-eltors. Thereâ€™s a fixed number of these scattered throughout, and when all are caught the whole game is won! Try not to be wounded or killed by enemies that may come to the foreground on certain areas, and be mindful of your surroundings both in space and on the ground (when implemented in the next iteration). 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Try to think of all the possible places these X-eltors may be in a level. They may be in space or on the ground, so use your access to both to your advantage.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You were relaxing on your home planet when one day a mysterious alien race showed up and stole your energy source, the X-eltors, and spread across the universe by these Aliens. Journey across several galaxies and planets solving different kinds of puzzles from space puzzles in your ship to platforming puzzles like never before with a split mechanic when you land on specific planets.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
All ages, although the game may be more popular with teenagers. Anyone who enjoys space and Sci-Fi </li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game itself takes as long as you may need to find all of the X-eltors scattered throughout, this involves jumping from planet to space and back to another planet so it may take a while.  You can play again if you lose or are damaged/killed.</li>
