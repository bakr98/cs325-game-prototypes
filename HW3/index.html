<h2>REVENGE of the GIANT STUFFED ANIMAL</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Author:</strong>	
	Bakr Marouf
</li>
	
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
	A giant stuffed animal has come from space to rescue its bretheren, unleash stuffed animals on the buildings where stuffed animals are calling for help and rescue all of the stuffed animals.
</li>
	
<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Able to create "bullet" rounds as well as synchroniously moving background elements and a panoramic background.
</li>
	
<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to create a swarm of objects for firing at other objects similar to bullets, and creating a moving background with elements that move dynamically in the background while the game is played.
</li>
	
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
	Some of prototype assets were made from scratch while others were borrowed, some were a combination of both.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The Giant Stuffed Savior has arrived! Try and rescue your stuffed bretheren from this prison planet and destroy these prisons to enact your revenge against those who took your species away.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Giant Stuffed Animal and Revenge
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Keyboard. Randomness: A lot. Play Styles: Achiever. Genre: Shooter
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating moving background elements as well as bullets and an open range for motion rather than being confined in a small space as with my previous games.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to go around this mystical prison world and experience the game firsthand while learning how to save the stuffed animals from their prisons.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The goal of the game is to save all of the stuffed animals on this planet. Thereâ€™s a fixed number of stuffed animals, and when all are caught you win! Try not to be wounded or killed by enemies that come to the foreground. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Try to go around as fast as possible and strike with multiple "bullets" at once.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Welcome to Xerthion-666, home to the most infamous prison in the Andromeda Galaxy. An entire species, the "stuffed" as they are called, have been imprisoned by an army of thugs and trapped, while you managed to escape and survive for 100 years. Now the time has come for you, the much larger GIANT STUFFED DOLPHIN, to return and save your species from this eternal imprisonment.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
All ages, although the game may be more popular with children. Anyone who enjoys Sci-Fi and/or Stuffed Animals</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game itself takes about 30-60 seconds to play. You can play again if you lose.</li>
