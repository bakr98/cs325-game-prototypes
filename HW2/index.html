<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The cats have been unleashed! Try to catch as many cats as possible to get as many points as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Person with lots and lots of cats
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Mouse. Randomness: A lot. Play Styles: Collector. Genre: Overhead
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating the group removal via touch/click, score tracker mechanic for catching cats.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
We want the players to first be surprised with the visuals and then experience the suspense that comes with the realization that they only have a limited time to catch as many cats as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The goal of the game is to catch as many cats as possible. There’s a random number of cats as well as their position. There is enough so the player won’t run out. You play my clicking on the cats to catch them. You want to catch as many as possible as that is your score which you’re trying to get as high as possible. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Try to to click as many Kittens as possible. This may be made easier when using a mobile device/touch screen or a mouse rather than a trackpad.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Oh no! Somebody let the cats out of the bag! Quick, we have to catch the cats and bring them back before the sun sets and they are lost in the darkness. The setting is that the cats have been let out of their bag and immediately ran out into what looks like a stampeed of cats in the open field. It’s almost night and you want to bring as many in before the sun sets and they're lost for the night. There’s only so much time you have before the sun sets so catch them quickly. Hopefully you don’t leave to many cats out in the wilderness. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
All ages, although the game may be more popular with children. Anyone who enjoys cute cats.</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game has a 30 second timer, so the game itself takes about 30 seconds to play. You can play again/retry thus adding another 30 seconds.</li>
