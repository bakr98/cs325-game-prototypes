<h2>Who let the cats out of the bag?</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Authors:</strong>	
	Bakr Marouf and Timothy Lilly
</li>
	
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
	The cats have escaped and we must catch them in a way never before seen, lots of cats that play a sound when caught (aka clicked or tapped).
</li>
	
<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Able to add thousands (and more tested) of cats to a group and able to remove them, add to the overall score, and play a sound. The overall score and other variables are passed between scenes.
</li>
	
<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
We learned how to remove objects from group using the remove() function and compared it to the kill() function which did not function as intended in our testing. 
The easiest part was after gettting into the flow of making the game (post-designing the mechanics).
</li>
	
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
	Some of prototype assets were made from scratch while others were borrowed, some were a combination of both.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>The main example used as a template for this game was template-gamestate-functional</li>
<li>The remove from groups functionality was inspired by <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/groups/remove">Remove From Group Example</a></li>
<li>Used for reference - Signals <a href="https://phaser.io/docs/2.6.2/Phaser.Signal.html">Phaser documentation on Signals</a></li>
<li>Used for reference - Timers <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/time/custom-timer">Phaser documentation on Timers</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The cats have been unleashed! Try to catch as many cats as possible to get as many points as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Person with lots and lots of cats
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Mouse. Randomness: A lot. Play Styles: Collector. Genre: Overhead
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating the group removal via touch/click, score tracker mechanic for catching cats.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
We want the players to first be surprised with the visuals and then experience the suspense that comes with the realization that they only have a limited time to catch as many cats as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The goal of the game is to catch as many cats as possible. There’s a random number of cats as well as their position. There is enough so the player won’t run out. You play by clicking on the cats to catch them. You want to catch as many as possible as that is your score which you’re trying to get as high as possible. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Try to to click as many Kittens as possible. The black cats are special and are worth 20 points! Gameplay may be made easier when using a mobile device/touch screen or a mouse rather than a trackpad.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Oh no! Somebody let the cats out of the bag! Quick, we have to catch the cats and bring them back before the sun sets and they are lost in the darkness. The setting is that the cats have been let out of their bag and immediately ran out into what looks like a stampeed of cats in the open field. It’s almost night and you want to bring as many in before the sun sets and they're lost for the night. There’s only so much time you have before the sun sets so catch them quickly. Hopefully you don’t leave to many cats out in the wilderness. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
All ages, although the game may be more popular with children. Anyone who enjoys cute cats.</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game has a 30 second timer, so the game itself takes about 30 seconds to play. You can play again/retry thus adding another 30 seconds.</li>
